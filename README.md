# Day 1 Introduction

## Scope of the course
	This course will explore searching of the internet. Please be aware that the art and science of searching extremely large data sources is one of the oldest, most studied, and complex topics in all of information technology. Basic searching techniques have become simple to perform. Anyone who has used a computer connected to the internet has performed searches, perhaps without knowing they are doing so. I will introduce extensions beyond basic searching, but in four classes of well under two hours each, I can only point out some places where you can explore in depth. That exploration is up to you, depending on your interest and your perseverance. 
	
	The instructor (hereafter known as "I", "me", or "Lewy") will use his (I'm male) personal MacBook Pro running Mac OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.5 for examples and demonstrations. However, the principles of internet searching apply to any operating system including Windows. A Windows computer is available if people want to see how things are done using that OS. I have not used Windows in years, so do not expect amazing, wizardly tips.

## Limitations:
	Access to the internet is available from our classroom, but it is unlikely that everyone can connect at the same time. The instructor will use a separate connection so that he doesn't get locked out by network overload.
	
	Most of the capability to search the internet is dependent on software running on a remote computer. The search capabilities are only marginally related to to the browser you use. Your choice of browser will be touched on only lightly and is mostly decided by personal taste and ease of use. My primary browsers are Chrome, Firefox. I occasionally use Safari or Tor, both of which may be chosen for capabilities unique to what they do in specific circumstances.  

## Conventions
	I have provided a **Notes File** which contains text from the lecture part of the class, links to  sites with relevant information, and suggestions for search terms on specific topics. The Notes File is available from the OLLI Web server (see below).
	
	The  Notes File is provided in PDF (Portable Document Format), which should be readable on any computer. This file is intended to relieve you of the need to copy to paper links and comments from class. I **strongly encourage** you to download the Notes File and save it on your computer. The text is provided in PDF format (Portable Document Format).  All of the searches, downloads, and supporting materials can be used from any location where you have access to the internet. I suggest you work with the Notes File  from home.  Most browsers will take you to the destination website if you click on the link. Work with the PDF file, not a print out. 
	
### Using links to additional information ###

Links to web sites should appear in blue text. There are two formats for links: the full link or a shortened link. For example, **access to the OLLI server** is available in two formats. Both forms will take you to the same place. Most browsers will allow you to click on a link to go there.
	
https://uaf.edu/olli/classes-and-lectures/reference-materials-for-s/ (long form)
or
https://goo.gl/Y4G4lI (short form)

Either form of these links will take you to the same internet site. The short form is provided to avoid what are often very long internet addresses. I will often use the short form

### Search for information

You will also encounter a set of search terms which will help you to search the internet for multiple sites related to our discussions. The prefix **Search for:** will be followed by a few keywords. Copy the keywords listed, paste them into the search field of your browser, and execute the search. This should return a list of web sites on our current topic. Browse through some of them for more information on the topic.

## Home Tasks ##

1.  Download the Notes File from the OLLI server and save it on your computer. When you are working with the file, use the saved PDF version, not a printed copy. The Notes File is small and should not take long to download.  
2.  Visit the page at http://goo.gl/ZTnBNl . This page is from About.com/tech on the topic of searching. Read or at least look through the different pages on searching.

# DAY 2 The Surface Web #

## Introduction ##

This course draws heavily on http://goo.gl/apdQTS (from https://about.com). Exploring this link will lead you down a long  trail of breadcrumbs about many aspects of internet searching. As Wendy Boswell wrote at http://websearch.about.com/od/internetresearch/a/whatissearch.htm, updated 

>   Updated February 20, 2016.
There are three basic types of search tools that most people use to find what they are looking for on the Web (there's more than this, but these are the basics that everyone should start with):

>>Search Engines
>>Subject Directories
>>MetaSearch Tools

>None of these search tools allow you to search the entire Web; that would be an almost impossible task. However, you can use these Web search tools to scour different parts of the Web, obtain different types of information, and broaden your Web search horizons.

>**Search the Web with Search Engines**

>Search engines are large, spider created databases of web pages that help searchers find specific information on any given subject. You type in a keyword or phrase and the search engine retrieves pages that correspond to your search query.

>Search results gathered from these search engines are not always relevant to the keywords entered, since these engines are not intuitive and cannot infer dynamically what it is you might be searching for (although results are getting better all the time).

The simplest form of searching is to type a plain language question in the search bar of your browser and press return. An alternative is to go to a website such as Google which offers a web interface to the Google Search Engine.  Note that Google is but one such web interface to proprietary search engines.

Some browsers allow you to specify which search engine you want to use for any default searches. This makes it easy to use a favorite search engine without going through a web page to use it. Both Google and Firefox browser offer this option. Other browsers may offer the same kind of choices. I haven't tried all the browsers, of course. There are far too many.

For example, visit http://goo.gl/CxQmfj for a sample of 10 different search engines. You can also continue to scroll down the page for related information and topics. I will visit this site in class to show you what it is like

## Add Filters to your searches

Search Engines have been adding Artificial Intelligence  (AI) or Machine Intelligence (MI) to the software involved in the process.  A simple query is often sufficient, but may produce a lot of responses to the query. Fortunately, it is possible to add refinements to reduce the responses. This practice is commonly known as "filtering" and is dependent on which search tool you are using. Filtering with Google will be different from filtering with Firefox or with DuckDuckGo.
	
To see a list of filters **for Google searches**, go to https://goo.gl/6aP09x. Remember that these filters apply only to Google,. In addition, Google has discontinued use of the + symbol to require that a search item is required to be present in the results. Other search engines often use a similar a similar set of codes, including + symbol. Look for filter definitions for search engines you may use.


# Day 3 Subject Directories #

## Use Subject directories to narrow your search ##

There are many directories covering limited, specialized searches. For example, you may find directories which index sites that focus on books, or free books, directories about gardening, or ... well, pretty much any topic or subject in which you are interested.


# Day 4 The Deep (or Dark) Web #

The deep web, sometimes called the dark web may provide access to local databases which are not interesting or even accessible to the general public and, therefore, are not indexed by major search engines. These might include access to local libraries, databases containing property ownership in your area, a listing of sex offenders or other criminals, and on and on. The OLLI database of classes which you used to download the Notes File for this course is a part of the deep web. 
	
## Evaluations

As usual in OLLI classes, we ask that you fill out an evaluation of this course and the instructor. I use these to adapt future courses that I may teach and to build on the experiences of my students and myself. I pay attention, including suggestions for future courses. Anonymous evaluations are fine, but, if you want, you are welcome to include contact information and I will contact you about the course and your opinions.
