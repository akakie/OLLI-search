#README

This repository holds class notes for my courses taught at Osher Lifelong Learning Institute through Summer Session at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. 

Content of the course notes is published for use by OLLI students enrolled in the course. It is available to others if you find it interesting or of use. Some rights are reserved, but the intent is to make it generally available. Further information about licensing will be added later.

##Caveat Emptor

The notes may or may not be useful to anyone who is not or has not enrolled in the corresponding class. Use at your own risk.
