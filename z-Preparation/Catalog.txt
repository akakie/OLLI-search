Searching the Internet

This class will cover searching on the internet. We begin with a basic internet search, which most people will already know. During the course we will examine the link between browsers, search engines, and some increasingly advanced search tactics. The instructor will use a Mac for demonstrations, but the content is largely independent of your operating. The course is available for people using MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Bring to class your internet compatible device, but be aware that internet connections from the OLLI building may not be reliable. Do not blame the instructor or OLLI if connections are shaky. We do not have control of the access. The instructor will use a different method of connecting which may prevent the instructor from being unable to connect.
