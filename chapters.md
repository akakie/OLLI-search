# Day 1

## Scope of the course
	This course will discuss searching of the internet. The instructor will use his personal MacBook Pro running Mac OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.5 for examples and demonstrations. 
	However, the principles of searching apply to any operating system including Windows. A Windows computer is available if people want to see how things are done using that OS. The instructor hasn't used Windows in years, so do not expect amazing, wizardly tips.

## Limitations:
	Access to the internet is available from our classroom, but it is unlikely that everyone can connect at the same time. The instructor will use a separate connection so that he doesn't get locked out by network overload.
	Note that not all browsers will be able to process some of the search commands we will cover. We will discuss choosing a browser, but your personal preferences are as important as the technical aspects of the browser. Most current browsers will perform adequate searches for common needs.

## Conventions
	The Notes File from the instructor contains instructor provided text, links to  sites with relevant information, and suggestions for search terms on specific topics. The Notes File is available from the OLLI Web server.
	
	The  Notes File is provided in PDF (Portable Document Format), which should be readable on any computer. This file is intended to relieve you of the need to copy to paper links and comments from class.
	
	I strongly encourage you download the Notes File and save it on your computer. It contains the text from which the class is presented, links to assorted web sites, and search phrases which you can use to find additional information on topics in the class.
	
	All of the searches, downloads, and supporting materials can be used from any location where you have access to the internet. I suggest you work with the Notes File from home. Work with the PDF file, not a print out.
	
### Links to additional information ###

Links to web sites should appear in blue text. There are two formats for links: the full link or a shortened link. For example, access to the OLLI server is available in two formats. Both forms will take you to the same place. Most browsers will allow you to click on a link to go there.
	
https://uaf.edu/olli/classes-and-lectures/reference-materials-for-s/ (long form)
or
https://goo.gl/Y4G4lI (short form)

These links will take you to another internet site which will provide additional information on the current topic.

### Search for information

You will also encounter a set of search terms which will help you to search the internet for multiple sites related to our discussions. The prefix **Search for:**_ will be followed by a few words. Copy the words listed, paste them into the search field of your browser, and execute the search. This should return a list of web sites on our current topic. Browse through some of them for more information on the topic.

## Home Tasks ##

1. Download the Notes File from the OLLI server and save it on your computer. When you are working with the file, use the saved PDF version, not a printed copy. The Notes File is small and should not take long to download.
2. Visit the page at http://goo.gl/ZTnBNl . ( i) This page is from About.com/tech on the topic of searching. Read or at least look through the different pages on searching.

## Basic Searching
	The simplest form of searching is to simply type a question in the search bar and press return. This is often sufficient. We will experiment with this in the remaining time in the first day.
